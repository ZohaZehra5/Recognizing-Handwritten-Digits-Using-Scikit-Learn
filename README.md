# Recognizing Handwritten Digits Using Scikit Learn

The handwritten digit recognition is the capability of computer applications to recognize the human handwritten digits. Handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different shapes and sizes which makes it difficult for the machine to distinguish.

To deal with this issue, Python’s offers scikit-learn library.

Note: Python 3.7 is required to run this project.
